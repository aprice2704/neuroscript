Below is an illustrative **high-level** NeuroScript snippet showing how you might structure a top-level “murder investigation” procedure. It doesn’t dive into the granular steps of evidence analysis or forensic details—rather, it provides a **scaffold** for how an LLM (or human investigator) could break down the problem into **sub-procedures**, each of which can be further refined or implemented later.

```
DEFINE PROCEDURE InvestigateMurderScene(CrimeSceneData)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Orchestrate a murder investigation at a crime scene by coordinating sub-tasks 
             like securing the scene, gathering evidence, interviewing witnesses, 
             and generating a preliminary case report.
    INPUTS: 
        CrimeSceneData -> structured info about the scene (location, time, any known facts).
    OUTPUT: 
        CaseReport -> a structured record of evidence, witness statements, possible motives, 
                      and recommended next steps.
    ALGORITHM:
        1. Secure the crime scene to preserve evidence.
        2. Gather and document physical evidence (photos, blood samples, weapons).
        3. Identify and interview witnesses.
        4. Analyze all collected data for leads or contradictions.
        5. Compile a preliminary report (CaseReport) summarizing findings and suspects.
    CAVEATS: 
        - Each step should be handled by specialized sub-procedures for detail (e.g. “SecureScene”, “InterviewWitnesses”).
        - Any suspicious or ambiguous findings might require extended LLM-based analysis or deeper forensic procedures.
    EXAMPLES:
        InvestigateMurderScene(LocationID=457) => returns a structured CaseReport summarizing 
        evidence, suspect list, and recommended follow-up actions.
END

# 1. Secure the scene using a specialized sub-procedure
CALL SecureCrimeScene(CrimeSceneData)

# 2. Gather & document physical evidence
CALL GatherPhysicalEvidence(CrimeSceneData)  # Photos, footprints, weapon, etc.

# 3. Identify and interview witnesses
CALL IdentifyWitnesses(CrimeSceneData)
CALL InterviewWitnesses(CrimeSceneData)

# 4. Analyze combined evidence & statements
SET analysisSummary = CALL AnalyzeEvidenceAndStatements(CrimeSceneData)

# (Optional) Leverage LLM for deeper insights if needed:
# e.g., extracting detailed timeline from witness transcripts
SET timelineInsights = CALL LLM("Based on these statements: {{analysisSummary}}, 
    construct a possible timeline of events and highlight contradictions.")

# 5. Compile final preliminary report
SET CaseReport = CALL CompileCaseReport(CrimeSceneData, analysisSummary, timelineInsights)

RETURN CaseReport
```

### Sub-Procedures (Sketches)

Below are **placeholder** definitions for some referenced procedures, each of which can be expanded in detail. This highlights how you might **modularize** each major step:

```
DEFINE PROCEDURE SecureCrimeScene(CrimeSceneData)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Ensure no further contamination or tampering occurs.
    INPUTS: CrimeSceneData
    OUTPUT: None
    ALGORITHM:
        1. Establish perimeter.
        2. Restrict access only to authorized personnel.
        3. Document initial scene conditions.
END

```

```
DEFINE PROCEDURE GatherPhysicalEvidence(CrimeSceneData)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Collect and document tangible evidence (photos, footprints, potential weapon, etc.).
    INPUTS: CrimeSceneData
    OUTPUT: EvidencePackage (list of items, their locations, and relevant notes)
    ALGORITHM:
        1. Photograph the entire scene thoroughly.
        2. Mark and collect all visible evidence, label them with IDs.
        3. Record location/time of collection in a log.
    CAVEATS:
        - Must be consistent with chain-of-custody procedures.
END

```

```
DEFINE PROCEDURE InterviewWitnesses(CrimeSceneData)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Capture witness statements and initial impressions.
    INPUTS: CrimeSceneData -> which includes a list of identified witnesses
    OUTPUT: WitnessStatements -> collection of statements
    ALGORITHM:
        1. For each witness in CrimeSceneData.witnesses:
            - Conduct a structured interview.
            - Record essential answers in text form.
        2. Store or append each statement to a master record.
END

# Possibly some calls to LLM for summarizing or analyzing statements...
```

```
DEFINE PROCEDURE AnalyzeEvidenceAndStatements(CrimeSceneData)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Combine all gathered evidence, witness statements, and generate a summarized analysis.
    INPUTS: CrimeSceneData (with appended witness statements + physical evidence data)
    OUTPUT: analysisSummary (structured data capturing key findings, timeline, leads)
    ALGORITHM:
        - Cross-reference times, discovered objects, footprints, etc. 
        - Flag contradictory or suspicious points.
END

# Some logic or possible LLM calls for pattern-finding...
```

```
DEFINE PROCEDURE CompileCaseReport(CrimeSceneData, analysisSummary, timelineInsights)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Produce a preliminary "CaseReport" that investigators can use to guide next steps.
    INPUTS:
        CrimeSceneData
        analysisSummary -> findings from AnalyzeEvidenceAndStatements
        timelineInsights -> optional deeper details from LLM calls
    OUTPUT: CaseReport -> structured summary (suspects, timeline, recommended next steps)
    ALGORITHM:
        1. Synthesize a timeline from timelineInsights if present.
        2. List suspects, relevant evidence, open questions.
        3. Provide recommended next steps (further interviews, lab tests, etc.).
