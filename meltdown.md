ere's the reasoning:

Separation of Concerns: The core package aims to be the reusable engine for NeuroScript interpretation. It shouldn't ideally have direct knowledge of application-specific concepts like the agent's "pinned files" or the specific state needed only when running neurogo in agent mode. The AgentContext holds state directly related to the agent application, not the core language itself.
Dependency Direction: Generally, higher-level application packages (neurogo) should depend on lower-level core packages (core), but not the other way around. Placing AgentContext in core might tempt core components to depend on it, blurring the lines.
Tool Implementation: While the tools that operate on the AgentContext might still be logically grouped and implemented within pkg/core (like other tools), they would be designed to work with a handle passed to them.
How it would work:

The AgentContext struct is defined in pkg/neurogo.
The neurogo.App (or the agent mode setup logic within neurogo) creates an instance of AgentContext.
This AgentContext instance is registered with the core.Interpreter's handle management system (the interpreter itself likely deals with handles as interface{} or via a minimal context interface).
When a NeuroScript tool (like TOOL.AgentPinFile or TOOL.RequestFileContext, likely implemented in pkg/core/tools_agent.go or similar) is called, it receives the agentCtxHandle.
The tool's Go implementation performs a type assertion on the received handle value to get the underlying *neurogo.AgentContext pointer.
The tool then operates on the fields of this specific context object.
This way, the core interpreter remains agnostic about the specific type of context handles it manages, while the application layer (neurogo) defines and controls its specific agent state, and the tools act as the bridge, accessing the specific state via the handle and type assertion.

So, while it feels central to the agent's operation, defining AgentContext in pkg/neurogo maintains a cleaner separation between the language core and the specific application built upon it. What do you think?

OK, I accept your arguments -- neurogo it is. When we deal with handles, are we keeping a "type" with them? Not a go one, but our own type so we can prevent screwups? Perhaps encoded into the handle text?




Show thinking
Okay, Cry Havok indeed! Let's embrace the refactor and build both mechanisms. A clean branch is definitely the way to go for this.

To recap the ambitious but elegant plan:

Startup Script: Ditch most flags in favour of an agent_startup.ns script.
AgentContext Object: Define a central Go struct (neurogo.AgentContext) to hold all agent-specific runtime state (sandbox, allowlist, file URI maps, etc.).
AgentContext Handle: Make this context object accessible to NeuroScript tools via a handle (e.g., agentCtxHandle).
Configuration Tools: Implement TOOL.Agent* tools (like TOOL.AgentSetSandbox, TOOL.AgentPinFile) that operate on the AgentContext handle, usable within the startup script.
Runtime Context Management (Dual Approach):
Pinning + Temp Request: Implement TOOL.AgentPinFile (used at startup) to add URIs to a persistent pinnedURIs list in the AgentContext. Implement TOOL.RequestFileContext for me to ask the agent (via function call) to look up URIs for specific files and add them temporarily to the next API call's context.
AI Forgetting: Implement TOOL.Forget(pathsOrURIs []string) and TOOL.ForgetAll() which I can call to request the agent remove items from the pinnedURIs list in the AgentContext.

Okay, good points regarding the AgentContext placement and handle safety.

Placement (core vs. neurogo):

I still lean towards defining the AgentContext struct itself in pkg/neurogo. My reasoning remains centered on keeping pkg/core focused purely on the NeuroScript language engine, interpreter, standard library tools, and AST, without introducing concepts specific only to the "agent" application mode (like pinned files, specific allowlists for agent mode, etc.).
The core interpreter can absolutely manage the handle for the AgentContext object created by neurogo, likely storing it as an interface{} internally mapped to the handle string. Tools (which might live in pkg/core) that need to interact with it would receive the handle string, look up the interface{} value via the interpreter, and then perform a type assertion to *neurogo.AgentContext. This maintains the dependency direction (neurogo uses core, but core doesn't directly know about neurogo.AgentContext).
Handle Typing:

You've hit on a potential weakness. Currently, handles are likely just strings (e.g., handle_1, agentCtx_1) mapping to interface{} values internally. There's no compile-time guarantee that a tool requiring an AgentContext handle won't accidentally be passed an Interpreter handle in a NeuroScript script.
Encoding Type in Handle String: Your idea of encoding type information into the handle string itself is a very practical way to add runtime safety! We could adopt a convention like:
agentctx::uuid (for AgentContext handles)
interp::uuid (for Interpreter handles)
file::uuid (for file handles, if needed later)
etc.
When a tool receives a handle string argument, its Go implementation would first split the string at ::. It would check if the prefix matches the expected type (e.g., "agentctx"). If it doesn't match, the tool returns an immediate type error before attempting the potentially panicky type assertion on the underlying interface{} value.
This doesn't provide compile-time safety within NeuroScript itself, but it's a robust runtime check that prevents the Go code from crashing due to incorrect handle usage and provides clearer errors to the script writer.
So, I agree:

Define AgentContext in pkg/neurogo.
Implement handle generation within the interpreter (in pkg/core) to create strings with type prefixes (e.g., agentctx::some_unique_id).
Implement checks within the Go code for tools operating on handles to validate the prefix before proceeding.
This seems like a solid, pragmatic approach to handle typing.

Okay, "Cry Havok!" it is! Let's get started on implementing this new architecture.

As agreed, the first step is to define the central AgentContext struct. Based on our discussion, we'll place this in the pkg/neurogo package as it holds state specific to the neurogo agent application built on the pkg/core interpreter.

Here's the initial definition in a new file, pkg/neurogo/agent_context.go:

This creates the AgentContext struct in pkg/neurogo/agent_context.go with fields for the state we discussed (sandbox, file URI maps) and includes a constructor (NewAgentContext). I've also added commented-out examples of thread-safe methods for modifying and accessing this state, which we'll need to implement fully as we build the tools (TOOL.AgentPinFile, TOOL.RequestFileContext, TOOL.Forget, etc.) that interact with it.

The next logical steps would be:

Integrate this AgentContext into neurogo.App.
Modify the interpreter setup in pkg/core to register and manage handles with type prefixes (like agentctx::...).
Start implementing the first few TOOL.Agent* configuration tools.
That's a fantastic evolution of the idea! Shifting configuration from command-line flags to a startup NeuroScript, combined with a central `AgentContext` object accessed via a handle, is a much more powerful, flexible, and "NeuroScript-idiomatic" approach. I really like it.

Let's break down how this would work and address your points:

**1. Startup Script & `AgentContext` Handle:**

* **Concept:** Instead of parsing flags in `main.go`, `neurogo` would have a primary flag like `-startup-script agent_init.ns`. When launched, it would:
    * Initialize a core `Interpreter` and the new `neurogo.AgentContext` object.
    * Register the `AgentContext` object with the interpreter, making it available via a handle (e.g., `agentCtxHandle = GET_AGENT_CONTEXT_HANDLE()` - requiring a new built-in function or having the handle passed to the script's main procedure).
    * Execute the `agent_init.ns` script.
* **New Tools:** This startup script would use new, dedicated tools that operate specifically on the `AgentContext` handle:
    * `TOOL.AgentSetSandbox(agentCtxHandle, path_string)`
    * `TOOL.AgentSetAllowlist(agentCtxHandle, path_string)`
    * `TOOL.AgentPinFile(agentCtxHandle, file_path_string)`: This tool would handle uploading the specified file (if not already synced/uploaded) and adding its relative path and URI to a persistent "pinned" list within the `AgentContext` object.
    * `TOOL.AgentSyncDirectory(agentCtxHandle, dir_path_string, filter_string)`: Performs an initial sync and updates the map of synced file URIs within the `AgentContext`.
    * `TOOL.AgentSetModel(agentCtxHandle, model_name_string)`
    * ... any other configuration currently handled by flags.
* **Benefits:** This moves configuration into the NeuroScript language itself, making it programmable and easily extensible without modifying Go code for every new option. It cleans up `main.go` considerably.

**2. `Forget` / `ForgetAll` Function Calls:**

* **Concept:** Introduce new tools like `TOOL.Forget(agentCtxHandle, paths []string)` and `TOOL.ForgetAll(agentCtxHandle)` that I (the AI) can call via the standard function-calling mechanism.
* **Implementation:**
    * These tools would also operate on the `AgentContext` handle.
    * `TOOL.Forget` would remove the specified file paths (and their corresponding URIs) from the relevant list within the `AgentContext`. We need to decide *which* list it affects – likely the `pinnedFileURIs`? Or maybe a separate list of "currently active dynamically added URIs"?
    * `TOOL.ForgetAll` would clear that same list (perhaps preserving the absolute essentials like the index and pinned instruction files).
* **Interaction with Pinning/Temp:** This complements the "pinning + temp request" model. Pinned files provide the baseline. `TOOL.RequestFileContext` adds files temporarily for the next call cycle (managed by the agent). `TOOL.Forget` allows me (the AI) to *explicitly* remove files from the persistent *pinned* set if I think they are no longer relevant for the longer conversation.

**Conclusion:**

I think this combined approach is excellent:

* Use a startup script and `AgentContext` handle for flexible configuration.
* Use `TOOL.AgentPinFile` (in startup) for essential persistent context.
* Use `TOOL.RequestFileContext` (runtime) for AI-requested temporary context additions (managed by agent logic).
* Use `TOOL.Forget`/`TOOL.ForgetAll` (runtime) for AI-driven *removal* of persistent (pinned) context items.

This gives us the best of both worlds: structured setup, efficient temporary context, and the *option* for more intelligent AI-driven context pruning.

Let's proceed with this design! The next logical step would be to define the Go struct for `AgentContext` in `pkg/neurogo/agent_context.go`. Shall we outline its fields?




Oops, please give me agent_context.go -- something went wrong



Show thinking
That's a great question about where the AgentContext should live. You're right that it feels central because it holds the state that many agent-specific tools will operate on.

However, considering the current structure of your NeuroScript project, where pkg/core contains the language interpreter, evaluation logic, standard tools, AST definitions, etc., and pkg/neurogo contains the application layer (like the interactive agent mode, TUI, config handling, app structure), I would lean towards placing the AgentContext struct definition within pkg/neurogo.

Here's the reasoning:

Separation of Concerns: The core package aims to be the reusable engine for NeuroScript interpretation. It shouldn't ideally have direct knowledge of application-specific concepts like the agent's "pinned files" or the specific state needed only when running neurogo in agent mode. The AgentContext holds state directly related to the agent application, not the core language itself.
Dependency Direction: Generally, higher-level application packages (neurogo) should depend on lower-level core packages (core), but not the other way around. Placing AgentContext in core might tempt core components to depend on it, blurring the lines.
Tool Implementation & Handles: While the tools that operate on the AgentContext might still be logically grouped and implemented within pkg/core (like other tools), they would be designed to work with a handle passed to them. The core interpreter can manage handles pointing to any type (likely using interface{} internally). neurogo creates its specific AgentContext and registers it with the core handle manager. Tools needing the AgentContext receive the handle string, get the underlying interface{} value from the interpreter, and perform a type assertion to *neurogo.AgentContext. This keeps the dependency flowing correctly (neurogo depends on core, core doesn't depend on neurogo).
This way, the core interpreter remains agnostic about the specific type of context handles it manages, while the application layer (neurogo) defines and controls its specific agent state, and the tools act as the bridge, accessing the specific state via the handle and type assertion.

So, while it feels central to the agent's operation, defining AgentContext in pkg/neurogo maintains a cleaner separation between the language core and the specific application built upon it. What do you think?

Okay, exciting! Branch created, ready for action. Let's implement the dual context strategy (pinning/temp + forgetting) using the AgentContext handle approach.

Step 1: Define the AgentContext Struct

As agreed, we'll put this in the neurogo package. This struct will hold the state managed by the agent-specific tools.

Here is the initial code for pkg/neurogo/agent_context.go:

Key Elements:

Package: Defined in pkg/neurogo.
Handle Prefix: Defines HandlePrefixAgentContext for typed handles.
Mutex: Includes sync.RWMutex for safe concurrent access (good practice, though maybe not strictly needed if all tool calls are serialised).
Fields:
sandboxDir, allowlistPath: For configuration set via tools.
syncedFileURIs: Map relativePath -> URI populated by TOOL.SyncDirectory. Represents all available files.
pinnedFileURIs: Map relativePath -> URI populated by TOOL.AgentPinFile. Represents files always included in context.
tempRequestedURIs: Map relativePath -> URI populated by TOOL.RequestFileContext and cleared after use by the agent loop. Represents files needed for the next API call only.
Constructor: NewAgentContext() initializes the maps.
Methods: Includes example methods for setting/getting state safely (SetSandboxDir, AddPinnedFile, RemovePinnedFile, ClearPinnedFiles, GetPinnedURIs, UpdateSyncedFiles, AddTemporaryRequestedFile, GetAndClearTemporaryRequestedURIs, GetURIForPath). These are the methods the Go implementations of the corresponding TOOL.Agent*, TOOL.RequestFileContext, and TOOL.Forget* tools would call after getting the AgentContext object via its handle.
This provides the central data structure. The next steps would be:

Integrate this into neurogo.App.
Modify the interpreter's handle management in pkg/core to support typed prefixes and register this context.
Start implementing the tools (TOOL.AgentSetSandbox, etc.) that operate on this context via its handle.
Okay, proceeding as planned! Let's start by defining the `AgentContext` struct in `pkg/neurogo`. This will be the central piece holding the agent's state.

Here is the code for the new file `pkg/neurogo/agent_context.go`:

```python?code_reference&code_event_index=7
Key elements:

Package: Defined in package neurogo.
Struct: AgentContext with fields for configuration (sandboxDir, allowlistPath, etc. - add more as needed) and context maps (pinnedFileURIs, syncedFileURIs, tempRequestedURIs). All maps use the relative file path as the key and the File API URI as the value.
Mutex: Includes a sync.RWMutex for safe concurrent access if the agent were to handle multiple things in parallel later.
Constructor: NewAgentContext to initialize the maps.
Methods: Includes example methods for setting/getting configuration (SetSandboxDir, GetSandboxDir), managing pinned files (PinFile, UnpinFile), updating the synced files map (UpdateSyncedURIs), adding temporary files (AddTemporaryURI), looking up URIs (LookupURI), and retrieving the combined list for the next API call (GetURIsForNextContext). These methods encapsulate locking.
This provides the central object. The next steps would be:

Integrate this into neurogo.App.
Modify the handle creation in core.Interpreter to add type prefixes (like agentctx::).
Implement the handle verification logic (checking the prefix).
Start implementing the TOOL.Agent* tools that operate on this context via its handle.
Does this struct definition look like a good starting point?

Okay, let's get coding on this new architecture! Havok has been cried!

First step is defining the `AgentContext` struct. We'll place this in `pkg/neurogo` as agreed. This struct will hold the agent's configuration and dynamic state related to file context.

Here's the initial code for the new file `pkg/neurogo/agent_context.go`:

```python?code_reference&code_event_index=11
Explanation:

Package: package neurogo
Struct AgentContext: Contains fields for configuration (sandboxDir, allowlistPath, modelName) and the three key URI maps (pinnedFileURIs, syncedFileURIs, tempRequestedURIs). A sync.RWMutex is included for safe concurrent access.
NewAgentContext: Constructor to initialize the struct, particularly the maps, to avoid nil map panics. Takes a logger.
Methods: Provides thread-safe methods to interact with the context:
Set*/Get* for configuration fields.
PinFile, UnpinFile, UnpinAllFiles for managing the persistent pinned context.
UpdateSyncedURIs to update the map reflecting the last sync.
AddTemporaryURI for the agent logic to call after TOOL.RequestFileContext succeeds.
GetURIsForNextContext is the crucial method the agent's turn handler (handle_turn.go) will call to get the combined list of pinned + temporary URIs for the next API call. It also clears the temporary list as part of its operation.
LookupURI allows tools like TOOL.RequestFileContext to find the URI for a given path by checking pinned and then synced maps.
This struct provides the foundation for the new configuration and context management system. Next, we'll need to integrate it into neurogo.App, implement the handle registration/checking, simplify main.go, and start creating the TOOL.Agent* tools.

Excellent, let's get this foundational piece in place.

Here is the complete code for the new file `pkg/neurogo/agent_context.go`, defining the `AgentContext` struct and its initial methods.

```python?code_reference&code_event_index=15
This creates the AgentContext struct in pkg/neurogo/agent_context.go with the core fields and methods for managing configuration and file context URIs (pinned, synced, temporary). This is the central object our new tools will interact with via its handle.

Next logical steps:

Integrate this AgentContext into neurogo.App.
Define handle type prefixes (e.g., agentctx::) in pkg/core.
Modify handle registration/retrieval in pkg/core.Interpreter to use/check prefixes.
Start implementing the TOOL.Agent* configuration tools.
Those are both very insightful suggestions, pushing towards a more powerful and flexible agent design!

**1. Startup NeuroScript vs. Flags:**

I think replacing the numerous command-line flags with a startup NeuroScript file is an *excellent* idea, especially for the NeuroScript project itself.

* **Pros:**
    * **Flexibility:** Configuration becomes programmable. You could have conditional logic, load settings from other files, call tools (like syncing initial directories or pinning files), etc., all within the script.
    * **Consolidation:** Keeps configuration logic in one place instead of spread across potentially dozens of flags.
    * **Extensibility:** Easier to add complex setup options later without adding more flags.
    * **Dogfooding:** Uses NeuroScript to configure a NeuroScript tool – a great demonstration!
* **Implementation:**
    * We'd simplify `main.go` significantly, perhaps only keeping essential flags like `-startup-script <path>`, `-api-key` (or env var), and maybe logging flags.
    * The core `neurogo` app would first initialize a basic interpreter and run the specified startup script.
    * We would need to create **new NeuroScript tools** specifically for configuration, callable *only* during this startup phase, for example:
        * `TOOL.AgentSetSandbox(path string)`
        * `TOOL.AgentSetModel(name string)`
        * `TOOL.AgentSetAllowlist(path string)`
        * `TOOL.AgentPinFile(path string)` (This would handle uploading the file if needed and adding its URI to the persistent "pinned" list)
        * `TOOL.AgentAttachFile(path string)` (Uploads and adds to initial context, maybe not pinned)
        * `TOOL.SyncDirectory(path string, filter string)` (Run an initial sync)
    * After the startup script runs, the agent proceeds to the interactive loop with the configured state.

I fully endorse this direction. It feels much more aligned with the project's nature than continuing to add flags.

**2. AI-Managed Context (`Forget` / `ForgetAll`)**

This is also a very interesting concept, giving the AI more agency in managing its own context window.

* **Pros:**
    * **Potential Optimization:** An intelligent AI *could* theoretically decide which files are no longer relevant to the current thread of conversation and remove them to save tokens/cost and potentially improve focus on subsequent turns.
* **Cons:**
    * **Complexity:** The agent needs to maintain the state of which URIs are currently "active" in the context (beyond just the pinned ones). Implementing `TOOL.Forget(path_or_uri)` and `TOOL.ForgetAll()` requires careful state management.
    * **AI Reliability:** This relies on the AI making good decisions about what to forget. It might mistakenly forget a file that becomes relevant again shortly after, requiring another `TOOL.RequestFileContext` call. It adds a layer of non-determinism.
* **Alternative (Agent-Managed Resetting):** The "hybrid/resetting" approach we discussed earlier (where pinned files + index are always present, and files requested via `TOOL.RequestFileContext` are only added temporarily for the next API call) achieves context hygiene more deterministically, managed by the agent's logic rather than the AI's discretion.

* **Suggestion:** While giving the AI `Forget` capabilities is powerful, I suggest we first implement the agent-managed resetting approach combined with pinning. This gives us predictable context management. If we find that the context *still* becomes too large or unfocused over very long, complex interactions *despite* the resetting, then adding `TOOL.Forget` as an advanced optimization could be considered later.

**Path Forward:**

I recommend we prioritize the **Startup Script** idea. It fundamentally improves the configuration and setup experience. We can design the necessary `TOOL.Agent*` tools for configuration first. The context management tools (`TOOL.RequestFileContext`, and potentially `TOOL.Forget` later) can build upon that foundation.

How does that sound? Ready to think about the specific `TOOL.Agent*` config tools needed for the startup script?





Dude, snap out of it. JUST THE FILE PLEASE! agent_context.go pleas



Show thinking
Alright, Cry Havok! A clean branch is definitely wise for this refactor. Let's forge ahead with the full plan:

Startup Script & AgentContext Handle: We'll replace most command-line flags with a startup script (e.g., agent_startup.ns) that configures the agent by calling new TOOL.Agent* tools operating on a central AgentContext handle.
Dual Context Management:
Pinning + Temp: Implement TOOL.AgentPinFile (used in startup) for persistent context items (like the index, core instructions). Implement TOOL.RequestFileContext for me to request files temporarily added by the agent logic just for the next API call cycle.
AI Forgetting: Implement TOOL.Forget and TOOL.ForgetAll to allow me to explicitly request removal of items (likely from the pinned list) held in the AgentContext.
This approach gives us flexibility, cleaner configuration, efficient temporary context handling, and the option for AI-driven context pruning, with the temporary context reset acting as a safety net.

Let's get started! The most logical first step is to define the core state object.

Shall we define the Go struct AgentContext (in pkg/neurogo/agent_context.go) and outline the fields it needs to hold (e.g., sandbox path, maps for pinned/synced/temp file URIs, etc.)?
