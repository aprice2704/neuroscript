# Canary Test: High-Level Integration
#
# Purpose: This script serves as a vital "canary in the coal mine" for
# the entire NeuroScript toolchain. Its syntax touches on many core
# features (functions with returns, on error blocks, must, set, etc.).
#
# - If this test fails with a PARSER error, it indicates a fundamental
#   problem with the build process (e.g., a stale parser, a broken
#   Makefile dependency). DO NOT DEBUG THE SCRIPT until the build
#   process is verified.
#
# - If this test fails with a RUNTIME error, it indicates a regression
#   or bug in the interpreter's execution logic.
