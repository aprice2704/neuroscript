// Each builtin will be a type that implements the Pass interface
// and registers itself.

// Built-ins (in analysis/builtin.go):

// shapeValidator   (schema / Kind sanity)

// basicTypeCheck

// capabilityAudit   (tool usage)

// secretWhitelist   (no secret outside command)

// setOrder   (“no set after command{”)
