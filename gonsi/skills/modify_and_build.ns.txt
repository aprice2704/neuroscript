# NeuroScript Skill: Modify and Build Go Code
# Version 9: Corrected SPLAT, THEN, and placeholder usage.

DEFINE PROCEDURE ModifyAndBuildGoFile(relative_filepath, task_description) # Changed SPLAT
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Reads a Go file, asks an LLM to modify it, formats the code,
             writes it back, checks validity using TOOL.GoCheck (go list),
             and finally attempts to build using TOOL.GoBuild.
    INPUTS:
      - relative_filepath (string): Relative path to the Go file.
      - task_description (string): Description of the modification.
    OUTPUT:
      - status_message (string): Success or failure message including check/build status.
    ALGORITHM:
        1. Read original content -> LAST. Assign to original_code. Handle errors.
        2. Create LLM prompt using direct variables.
        3. Call LLM -> LAST. Assign to generated_code.
        4. Call TOOL.GoFmt(generated_code) -> LAST. Assign map to fmt_result.
        5. Check fmt_result["success"]. Decide code_to_write.
        6. Call TOOL.WriteFile(relative_filepath, code_to_write) -> LAST. Assign status. Handle errors.
        7. Call TOOL.GoCheck(relative_filepath) -> LAST. Assign map to check_result. Handle check errors.
        8. If GoCheck succeeds, call TOOL.GoBuild(relative_filepath) -> LAST. Assign map to build_result.
        9. Check build_result["success"] and return appropriate final status.
    CAVEATS: Relies on LLM accuracy. Uses direct variable access and LAST, assumes TOOLs return expected types/maps.
    EXAMPLES: CALL ModifyAndBuildGoFile("test_files/simple_test.go", "...") -> ...
