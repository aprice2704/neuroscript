DEFINE PROCEDURE Add(a, b)
COMMENT:
PURPOSE: Adds two numbers (currently performs string concatenation).
INPUTS:
 - a: First number (passed as string).
 - b: Second number (passed as string).
OUTPUT: The sum (a+b) (currently concatenated string).
ALGORITHM: Concatenates input strings using '+'. [TODO: Implement arithmetic evaluation].
CAVEATS: This performs string concatenation, NOT arithmetic addition yet.

# Note: Interpreter evaluates '+' as string concatenation currently.
# Arithmetic evaluation is a TODO feature.
SET result = a + b
