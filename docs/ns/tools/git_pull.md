 # Tool Specification: TOOL.GitPull (v0.1)

 * **Tool Name:** TOOL.GitPull (v0.1)
 * **Purpose:** Fetches changes from a remote repository and integrates them into the current local branch. Typically used to update the local branch with changes from the configured upstream remote.
 * **NeuroScript Syntax:**
   ```neuroscript
   pullResult := TOOL.GitPull()
   ```
 * **Arguments:**
    * None. The tool operates on the current repository state and its configured remote(s).
 * **Return Value:** (String)
    * On success: A string containing a success message and the standard output from the `git pull` command.
    * On failure: An error (e.g., network issues, merge conflicts). The error message will typically contain the standard error output from the `git pull` command for diagnostics.
 * **Behavior:**
    1. Executes the `git pull` command within the designated sandbox environment.
    2. The underlying `git pull` command fetches changes from the remote repository associated with the current branch (or the specified remote/branch if configured differently in Git).
    3. It then attempts to merge the fetched changes into the current local branch.
    4. If the fetch and merge are successful, the tool returns the standard output of the command.
    5. If `git pull` encounters an error (e.g., no network connection, authentication required but not configured, merge conflicts), the tool returns an error wrapping the standard error output from the Git command. Merge conflicts will require manual resolution outside of the script.
 * **Security Considerations:**
    * Executes an external process (`git`). Ensure the execution environment is secure.
    * Requires network access to communicate with remote Git repositories. Firewall rules might affect its operation.
    * Pulling code executes Git hooks present in the repository, which could be a security risk if the repository is untrusted. Execution within the NeuroScript sandbox relies on the `toolExec` function's security model.
    * Authentication: If the remote repository requires authentication (e.g., SSH key, HTTPS credentials), it must be pre-configured in the environment where the NeuroScript interpreter runs (e.g., via an SSH agent, Git credential helper). The tool itself does not handle interactive credential prompts.
 * **Examples:**
   ```neuroscript
   // Update the current branch from its upstream remote
   pullOutput := TOOL.GitPull()
   IO.Print("Git Pull Result:")
   IO.Print(pullOutput)
   ```
 * **Go Implementation Notes:**
    * Implemented in `pkg/core/tools_git.go` as `toolGitPull`.
    * Uses the `toolExec` helper function to run the `git pull` command.
    * Registered in `pkg/core/tools_git_register.go`.
