 # Tool Specification: TOOL.GitPush (v0.1)

 * **Tool Name:** TOOL.GitPush (v0.1)
 * **Purpose:** Updates remote refs using local refs, effectively publishing local commits to a remote repository.
 * **NeuroScript Syntax:**
   ```neuroscript
   pushResult := TOOL.GitPush()
   ```
 * **Arguments:**
    * None. This version pushes the current branch to its configured upstream remote (as defined by `branch.<name>.remote` and `branch.<name>.merge` in the Git config, or the default `origin` if not explicitly configured).
 * **Return Value:** (String)
    * On success: A string containing a success message and the standard output from the `git push` command.
    * On failure: An error (e.g., network issues, push rejected due to unmerged remote changes, authentication failure). The error message will typically contain the standard error output from the `git push` command for diagnostics.
 * **Behavior:**
    1. Executes the `git push` command within the designated sandbox environment.
    2. The underlying `git push` command attempts to send local commits from the current branch to its corresponding upstream branch on the configured remote repository.
    3. If the push is successful (the remote accepts the changes), the tool returns the standard output of the command.
    4. If `git push` encounters an error (e.g., no network connection, authentication required but not configured, push rejected because the remote branch has diverged), the tool returns an error wrapping the standard error output from the Git command. A rejected push typically requires a `TOOL.GitPull` first.
 * **Security Considerations:**
    * Executes an external process (`git`). Ensure the execution environment is secure.
    * Requires network access to communicate with remote Git repositories. Firewall rules might affect its operation.
    * Authentication: If the remote repository requires authentication (e.g., SSH key, HTTPS credentials), it must be pre-configured in the environment where the NeuroScript interpreter runs (e.g., via an SSH agent, Git credential helper). The tool itself does not handle interactive credential prompts.
    * Pushing changes modifies the remote repository state, potentially affecting other collaborators.
 * **Examples:**
   ```neuroscript
   // Assuming changes are committed, push the current branch to its upstream
   pushOutput := TOOL.GitPush()
   IO.Print("Git Push Result:")
   IO.Print(pushOutput)
   ```
 * **Go Implementation Notes:**
    * Implemented in `pkg/core/tools_git.go` as `toolGitPush`.
    * Uses the `toolExec` helper function to run the `git push` command.
    * Registered in `pkg/core/tools_git_register.go`.
