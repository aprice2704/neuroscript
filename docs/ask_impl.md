You've raised excellent points. Sticking to NeuroScript's core principles is key. Here’s a revised plan that incorporates your feedback.

### `ask`: Statement with `into` is the way to go.

You're right to question this. My view is that **`ask` should remain a statement with an `into` clause**, not become a function.

Here’s why:

  * **Clarity of Intent**: `ask` is a powerful I/O operation with significant side effects (network calls, cost, logging, potential for long execution times, streaming events). A statement makes this gravity explicit. A simple function call `set x = ask(...)` would misleadingly treat it like a trivial calculation, which violates the "no surprises" principle.
  * **Streaming Feels Natural**: With a statement, streaming via `emit` feels like a natural side effect of the `ask` operation. If it were a function, you'd have a weird state where a function is returning a value *and* triggering events before it completes. That's messy.
  * **Consistency**: Other I/O-heavy operations in NeuroScript are statements (`emit`, `fail`). `ask` fits this pattern perfectly.

So, we'll stick with the `ask ... with ... into ...` syntax. It's more verbose but far more honest about what's happening under the hood.

-----

### Revised Plan: `ask` Implementation

Here is the updated, more focused plan.

#### 1\. Configuration: Use NeuroScript, Not YAML

This is a great simplification. We'll manage configuration entirely within NeuroScript.

  * **Mechanism**: The interpreter will be configured to load and execute a specific `.ns` file on startup, for example, `config/ai.ns`.
  * **Implementation**:
    1.  Create a standard procedure within `config/ai.ns`, such as `_LoadAIConfiguration()`.

    2.  This procedure will `set` global variables or return a map containing all AI account configurations. For example:

        ```neuroscript
        // In config/ai.ns

        func _LoadAIConfiguration() returns config means
            set default_account = {
                "provider": "openai",
                "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
                "api_key": tool.os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
                "price_table": {"input_per_1k": 0.0002, "output_per_1k": 0.0008} // In CAD
            }
            set local_account = {
                "provider": "ollama",
                "base_url": "http://localhost:11434",
                "model": "llama3"
            }
            set config = {
                "default": default_account,
                "local": local_account
            }
            return config
        endfunc
        ```

    3.  The main Go application will create an interpreter instance, load `config/ai.ns`, run `_LoadAIConfiguration`, and use the returned map to configure the `AIProvider` manager.

This approach is more powerful, keeps everything in one language, and even allows for dynamic configuration (e.g., loading keys from the environment).

#### 2\. Core `ask` Enhancement

This part remains the same, but with the configuration sourced from the `.ns` file.

1.  **AST Update**: The `AskStmt` node in the AST will be updated to support the `with OptionsExpr` and `into LValue` clauses.
2.  **`executeAsk` Logic**: The `executeAsk` function in `interpreter_steps_ask.go` will be the heart of the implementation.
      * It evaluates the `with` map.
      * It selects the appropriate AI account configuration based on the `account` key in the `with` map, falling back to the "default" config.
      * It constructs an `AIRequest` struct from the merged options.
      * It calls the appropriate `AIProvider`.
      * It handles the response, including streaming events, error handling, and finally, assigning the result to the `into` variable.

#### 3\. Budgeting and Usage Reporting

This is a critical part of making `ask` production-ready.

  * The `AIProvider` interface will be responsible for returning a `Usage` struct containing `InputTokens`, `OutputTokens`, and `Cost`.
  * The interpreter will use the per-account `price_table` from the config to calculate the cost.
  * A summary event (e.g., `ai.ask.done`) will be emitted with the full usage details for auditing and logging.

-----

### Instructions for the Tools Team: You Are Clear to Start ✅

The plan for the **`tool.ai`** toolset is self-contained and ready for implementation. The tools (`Validate`, `Select`, `SelectMany`) only need to operate on standard NeuroScript maps and lists. Their logic does not depend on how the `ask` statement is implemented.

You can proceed with the following instructions:

1.  **Create a new tool package**: `pkg/tool/ai`.
2.  **Implement the tools**:
      * `Validate(value any, shape map, allow_extra? bool) -> bool`
      * `Select(value any, path any, missing_ok? bool) -> any`
      * `SelectMany(value any, extracts map, missing_ok? bool) -> map`
3.  **Adhere strictly to `json_lite_guide.md`**: Your implementation of path parsing and shape validation must follow this mini-spec precisely.
4.  **Unit Tests**: Please provide comprehensive unit tests covering all success and failure cases outlined in the guide.

This parallel approach will be very efficient. While your team builds the essential validation and extraction tools, the core interpreter team can focus on the `ask` statement's mechanics and provider integration.


NO global vars please. We'll define a custom fn that returns a set, then feed that set to a new built-in fn that interacts with ask behind the scenes (RegisterAgents ?)







Excellent. This is a much cleaner, more robust design. Using a dedicated registration function and avoiding global variables is absolutely the right way to go. It keeps the interpreter's state explicit and manageable.

Here is the updated plan incorporating your feedback.

-----

### The `ask` Workflow: A Refined Approach

We will make `ask` a statement, but its configuration will be managed by a new, dedicated built-in function that the **host application** calls during startup. This gives us the best of both worlds: clean, self-contained scripts and explicit, secure configuration.

#### 1\. Configuration via NeuroScript (`config/ai.ns`)

You are spot-on: no need for another format. We'll define agents in a standard NeuroScript file. The key is that this file doesn't set globals; it just contains a function that *returns* the configuration map.

```neuroscript
// In config/ai.ns

:: name: AI Agent Configuration
:: purpose: Defines all available AI agents for the 'ask' statement.

func _GetAgentDefinitions() returns agents means
    :: description: Returns a map where each key is an agent name
    ::            and each value is that agent's configuration.

    set agents = {
        "default": {
            "provider": "openai",
            "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
            "api_key": tool.os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            "price_table": {"input_per_1k": 0.0002, "output_per_1k": 0.0008} // CAD
        },
        "local": {
            "provider": "ollama",
            "base_url": "http://localhost:11434",
            "model": "llama3"
        },
        "creative": {
            "provider": "openai",
            "model": "gpt-4o",
            "api_key": tool.os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            "temperature": 0.8
        }
    }

    return agents
endfunc
```

#### 2\. New Built-in Function: `RegisterAgents`

This isn't a function for users to call within their scripts. It's a method on the Go `Interpreter` object for the host application to use during initialization.

**Go Implementation (in `pkg/interpreter/interpreter.go`):**

A new exported method will be added to the `Interpreter`.

```go
// In pkg/interpreter/interpreter.go

// A struct to hold the parsed configuration for a single agent.
type AgentConfig struct {
    Provider    string
    Model       string
    APIKey      string
    BaseURL     string
    Temperature float64
    PriceTable  map[string]float64
    // ... other fields
}

// RegisterAgents configures the available AI agents for the 'ask' statement.
// This should be called by the host application at startup.
func (i *Interpreter) RegisterAgents(config lang.Value) error {
    configMap, ok := config.(*lang.MapValue)
    if !ok {
        return lang.NewRuntimeError(lang.ErrorCodeType, "agent configuration must be a map", nil)
    }

    // This map will live inside the interpreter's private state, not as a global variable.
    i.state.aiAgentConfigs = make(map[string]AgentConfig)

    for name, agentVal := range configMap.Value {
        agentMap, ok := agentVal.(*lang.MapValue)
        if !ok {
            // Error: agent definition for 'name' is not a map
            continue
        }

        // ... logic to parse the agentMap into an AgentConfig struct ...
        // ... and store it in i.state.aiAgentConfigs[name] ...
    }

    return nil
}
```

**Host Application Bootstrap Sequence:**

The Go program that uses the interpreter will now have a clear setup flow:

1.  Create a new interpreter instance.
2.  Load and execute `config/ai.ns`.
3.  Run the `_GetAgentDefinitions` procedure to get the configuration map.
4.  Call `interpreter.RegisterAgents()` with the returned map.
5.  The interpreter is now fully configured and ready to execute user scripts that use the `ask` statement.

#### 3\. The `ask` Statement Execution

The logic inside `executeAsk` now becomes clean and safe:

  * It checks the `with` block for an `"agent": "name"` key. If not present, it defaults to `"default"`.
  * It retrieves the configuration for that agent from its internal, non-global state (`i.state.aiAgentConfigs`).
  * It uses that configuration to make the call. If the agent name doesn't exist, it returns a clear runtime error.

This design is excellent. It's secure, testable, and avoids any "magic" or hidden global state.

-----

### Instructions for the Tools Team: Unchanged, Clear to Proceed ✅

Your instincts are correct. **The tools team does not need any changes to their plan.**

The work on `tool.ai.Validate`, `tool.ai.Select`, and `tool.ai.SelectMany` is entirely decoupled from the `ask` statement's internal implementation. They operate on the *result* of an `ask` call (a map), not on how that result was obtained.

You can give them the green light to start immediately based on the previous instructions and the `json_lite_guide.md`. Their work can proceed in parallel without any blockers.


Sounds good, except, again, no special fns or pre-defined flow just the internal RegisterAgents. What advantage would having the host implicitly doing the agent reg have?


You are absolutely right. My apologies for re-introducing an implicit step. Your push for explicitness is the correct path and aligns perfectly with NeuroScript's design philosophy. Forcing the host application to mediate the configuration is a superior design.

Let's remove that implicit flow. Here is the refined, more robust plan.

-----

### Advantage of the Host-Driven Model

You asked what advantage this model has. It's significant:

  * **Security and Control**: The host application (the main Go program running the interpreter) acts as a definitive gatekeeper. It decides *which* agent configurations are loaded and *when*. User scripts cannot load or define their own agents, preventing them from, for example, pointing the interpreter at a malicious endpoint or using an unauthorized, high-cost model. The host has total control over the "blessed" set of AI configurations.
  * **Testability**: This design is vastly easier to test. In our Go tests, we can create an interpreter instance and programmatically call `RegisterAgents` with a mock configuration. We don't need to depend on the file system or parse a separate config script, allowing for fast, isolated unit tests of the `ask` statement's logic.
  * **Clarity and Explicitness**: There is no "magic." The flow is `Go Host -> Runs Config Script -> Gets Map -> Registers Map with Interpreter`. It's a clear, traceable sequence of operations, which is exactly what we want to avoid surprises.

-----

### The Final Plan: Host-Driven Configuration

This is a clean, three-part architecture: the config, the host, and the runtime.

#### 1\. The Configuration Script (`config/ai.ns`)

This remains a standard NeuroScript file, containing a function that returns the agent definitions as a map. It has no special properties; it's just a script that produces data.

```neuroscript
// In config/ai.ns
func _GetAgentDefinitions() returns agents means
    set agents = {
        "default": { /* ...config... */ },
        "creative": { /* ...config... */ }
    }
    return agents
endfunc
```

#### 2\. The Host Application's Responsibility

This is the Go program that embeds the NeuroScript interpreter. It is now explicitly responsible for wiring everything together.

**Bootstrap Sequence:**

1.  **Instantiate Interpreter**: Create a new interpreter instance.
    ```go
    interp := interpreter.NewInterpreter()
    ```
2.  **Load & Run Config Script**: The host explicitly loads the `ai.ns` file and runs the designated function to get the configuration map.
    ```go
    configScript, _ := os.ReadFile("config/ai.ns")
    interp.LoadString(string(configScript)) // Assumes a method to load script without running
    agentConfigValue, _ := interp.Run("_GetAgentDefinitions")
    ```
3.  **Register Agents**: The host takes the returned value and explicitly passes it to the new `RegisterAgents` method on the interpreter.
    ```go
    err := interp.RegisterAgents(agentConfigValue)
    if err != nil {
        // Handle bad configuration
    }
    ```
4.  **Execute User Scripts**: The interpreter is now fully configured and ready to safely execute user scripts that contain `ask` statements.

#### 3\. The Interpreter's Implementation

  * **`RegisterAgents` Method**: This new, exported Go method on the `Interpreter` struct accepts a `lang.Value` (which must be a map). It parses this map into internal `AgentConfig` structs and stores them in a private field like `i.state.aiAgentConfigs`. It does **not** touch the script's variable scope.
  * **`executeAsk` Logic**: When the `ask` statement is executed, it reads the `"agent"` name from the `with` options. It then looks up that agent's configuration *only* from its private, internal `aiAgentConfigs` map. If the agent name isn't found, it fails with a runtime error.

This model is clean, secure, and directly implements the explicit control you're looking for.

-----

### Instructions for the Tools Team: No Changes, Green Light ✅

The `tool.ai` team's mission is unchanged and unblocked. Their work on `Validate`, `Select`, and `SelectMany` is entirely independent of this `ask` implementation detail.

They are clear to start development based on the `json_lite_guide.md` and previous instructions.


AJP: Upon reflection, I think it would be better if:

1. Let us call the things we are registering AgentModels since they are the model part of agents, not truly agents (that happens in fdm for example where an agent has a model, interpreter, storage etc.)
2. we do all the agentmodel reg etc. via tools; so:
3. base interpreter is started via the host prog and executes its startup script
4. that script has the agentmodel register, update and delete tools in its allowlist (default allowlist does not contain these btw, default denylist does, so startup script gets special ones). These tools should probably have a flag to say they are "config" ones.
5. script sets up agentmodels as it pleases
6. once registered, agentmodels stay usable via ask for the lifetime of the interpreter
7. we'll need list and select tools. select will choose an agentmodel using a variety of criteria
Later, we may need the ability for an interpreter to inherit agentmodels from each other, but not yet
Make sense?


Yes, that makes perfect sense. This is a much more elegant and powerful approach. It fully embraces the "everything is scriptable" philosophy of NeuroScript by moving agent configuration out of the Go host and into a privileged script, managed by tools.

This design is superior because it makes the agent setup process itself dynamic and programmable. Here is the updated plan based on your reflection.

-----

### The Final Plan: Configuration via Privileged Tools

The core idea is to treat AgentModel configuration as a runtime operation performed by special tools that are only available to a trusted "startup" script.

#### 1\. Terminology: "AgentModels"

Agreed. We will use the term **AgentModel** to refer to the configuration of a specific AI model (e.g., GPT-4o with certain settings), as this is distinct from a higher-level FDM agent that might *use* an AgentModel.

-----

#### 2\. The New `tool.agentmodel.*` Toolset

Instead of a `RegisterAgents` method in Go, we will create a new suite of tools for this purpose. These tools will be marked as "config" tools and will be disabled by default for all standard interpreters.

**Tool Specifications:**

  * **`tool.agentmodel.Register(name: string, config: map) -> bool`**

      * **Purpose**: Registers a new AgentModel configuration under a given `name`.
      * **Behavior**: Takes a name and a map containing the configuration (`provider`, `model`, `api_key`, `price_table`, etc.). Stores this configuration in the interpreter's private state. Returns `true` on success. It will fail if an AgentModel with that name already exists.

  * **`tool.agentmodel.Update(name: string, updates: map) -> bool`**

      * **Purpose**: Merges a map of `updates` into an existing AgentModel's configuration.
      * **Behavior**: This allows for changing a model's temperature or API key without re-registering the entire configuration. Fails if the named AgentModel does not exist.

  * **`tool.agentmodel.Delete(name: string) -> bool`**

      * **Purpose**: Removes a registered AgentModel from the interpreter.
      * **Behavior**: Returns `true` if the AgentModel was found and deleted, `false` otherwise.

  * **`tool.agentmodel.List() -> list<string>`**

      * **Purpose**: Returns the names of all currently registered AgentModels.

  * **`tool.agentmodel.Select(criteria: map) -> string`**

      * **Purpose**: Intelligently select the *name* of the best-suited AgentModel.
      * **Behavior**: The `criteria` map could include keys like `"provider"`, `"min_tokens"`, `"capability": "vision"`, etc. The tool will return the name of the first AgentModel that satisfies all criteria. This logic can be simple at first (exact key-value matches) and grow more sophisticated over time.

-----

#### 3\. The Startup and Execution Flow

This defines a clear separation between the privileged setup environment and the standard execution environment.

1.  **Host Instantiates Interpreter**: The host Go program creates a new interpreter instance. Crucially, it will use a `WithTools(...)` or `WithAllowlist(...)` option to grant this instance access to the `tool.agentmodel.*` toolset. This is the security gate.

2.  **Host Runs Startup Script**: The host loads and executes a trusted startup script (e.g., `init.ns`).

3.  **Startup Script Configures Environment**: This script uses the privileged tools to set up the environment.

    ```neuroscript
    // In init.ns (the startup script)

    :: description: Sets up the available AI AgentModels for this runtime.

    // Register the default OpenAI model
    must tool.agentmodel.Register("default", {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "api_key": tool.os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    })

    // Register a local model
    must tool.agentmodel.Register("local-llama", {
        "provider": "ollama",
        "base_url": "http://localhost:11434",
        "model": "llama3"
    })

    emit "AgentModels registered: " + tool.agentmodel.List()
    ```

4.  **Interpreter is Ready**: After the startup script completes, the interpreter instance is now fully configured with a set of available AgentModels. This state persists for the lifetime of the interpreter object.

5.  **User Scripts Run**: Subsequent, untrusted user scripts are run using this same interpreter instance. These scripts can use the `ask` statement, which will reference the AgentModels registered in step 3. They will **not** have access to the `tool.agentmodel.Register` tools unless the host explicitly allows it.

-----

#### 4\. `ask` Statement Logic

The `ask` statement's implementation remains simple. It reads the `agent` name from its `with` clause (defaulting to `"default"`) and looks up the corresponding configuration from its internal state, which was populated by the `tool.agentmodel.Register` tool.

This model is a significant improvement. It is flexible, secure, and keeps the core logic within NeuroScript itself.

-----

#### 5\. Instructions for the Tools Team (`tool.ai.*`)

The instructions for the **`tool.ai.*`** team (`Validate`, `Select`, `SelectMany`) are **still unchanged and unblocked**. Their work is focused on data manipulation and is completely independent of the AgentModel registration process. You can give them the final green light to begin.



AJP: Thinking about it .... `ask` should always take two required arguments `ask <agentmodel>, <prompt>` so we never use defaulted or implicit model names please.


G2.5: Excellent. That's a much clearer and more robust design. Making the `AgentModel` an explicit, required argument aligns perfectly with the NeuroScript principle of "no surprises." It completely removes any ambiguity.

Based on this, the new syntax would be:
`ask <agentmodel_expression>, <prompt_expression> [with <options_map>] [into <variable>]`

This will require updating the `NeuroScript.g4` grammar rule for `ask_stmt` to:
`ask_stmt: KW_ASK expression COMMA expression (KW_WITH expression)? (KW_INTO lvalue)?;`

And the corresponding interpreter logic will change to:
1.  Evaluate the **first expression** to get the `AgentModel` name.
2.  Evaluate the **second expression** to get the prompt.
3.  The `with` map no longer needs to specify an `agent`; it would only be for overrides like `temperature`.

This is a superior approach. I will proceed with this new design. Please let me know which file you would like me to update first with this new rule.
