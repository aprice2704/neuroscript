# How the NS repo and Site are structured

## Repo Dirs

1. `/pkg` contains the shared source code of NS
2. `/cmd` contains source code for various cli tools
3. `/bin` is currently unused
4. `/docs` contains most of the md documentation files
5. `/project` contains operational files for running the ns project
6. `/site` is the documentation generated by mkdocs from docs
7. `/library` contains ns and nd files to do useful things

## Some root files

8. `/index.html` is the website landing page
9. `/README.md` is front page matter for the github repo
10. `/AI_README.md` contains instructions for AIs working on the project

## mkdocs

We use mkdocs to generate the technical documentation. This should be run with `mkdocs build` from root, it will **erase and rebuild** /site/...

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` should trigger do this automatically on github and send the results to the `gh-pages` branch.
