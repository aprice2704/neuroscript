From Gemini:

Here are some thoughts on how conversation management could be enhanced beyond generic approaches, particularly in a system like yours:

Structured and Dynamic Context Management:

Instead of just a flat history, the system could maintain a more structured context for each AI worker or task. This might include explicit fields for:
Current Goal/Objective: What is the AI trying to achieve right now?
Key Facts & Entities: Information gathered or established that's critical for the current task (e.g., specific file paths being worked on, error messages encountered, user decisions).
Constraints & Rules: Any active rules or limitations for the operation.
Session-Specific Knowledge: Things learned or decided earlier in the current interaction that should guide future steps.
This structured context can be dynamically updated by the AIWM or even by NeuroScript tools as a task progresses.
Intelligent Prompt Assembly:

Move beyond just concatenating a system prompt, history, and the latest query.
Prompts could be assembled on-the-fly based on the current structured context, the specific sub-task, and critically, relevant "lessons learned."
For instance, if the "lessons learned" indicate that a particular AI worker definition tends to misunderstand a certain type of instruction, the prompt assembly logic could dynamically inject a clarifying note or a successful example from a past interaction when a similar instruction is needed.
Sophisticated Context Distillation & Summarization:

For long-running tasks or extended interactions, the raw conversational history can become noisy.
More advanced techniques could be used to distill or summarize older parts of the context, focusing only on what's relevant to the current step. This could even involve a dedicated LLM call to perform the summarization with a specific focus, ensuring the primary AI worker isn't bogged down by less pertinent details from many turns ago. This actively combats the "turn warp" you've experienced.
Layered and Scoped Context:

Think of context in layers:
Global/System: Core instructions, AI persona (from AIWorkerDefinition).
Session/Task: Overarching goals for the current session or multi-step task.
Local/Turn: Specifics of the immediate request and very recent history.
The conversation management system could be smarter about which layers are most relevant and how to combine them effectively.
Explicit State Tracking and Checkpointing:

For complex, multi-turn operations (which your "stateful worker interaction" in road_to_04.md hints at), the system could explicitly manage and track the state of the interaction.
This could involve inserting "state summaries" or "checkpoints" into the context that the AI is guided to refer to, re-anchoring its understanding periodically.
Feedback-Driven Contextual Adjustments:

The "lessons learned" mechanism you're designing for the Work Queue is key here. If a certain approach (e.g., a particular prompt phrasing or set of supporting information) consistently leads to better or worse outcomes for specific tasks, the conversation management system can learn to adjust what information it emphasizes or includes.
Specialized Roles in Conversation Management:

It's possible to envision a system where a primary "task execution AI" is supported by other specialized AI components or rule-based systems that manage parts of the conversation, like a "context manager" AI that prepares the optimal context packet for the task AI.
