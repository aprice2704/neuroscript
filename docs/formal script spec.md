# NeuroScript: Formal specification

Version: 0.1.0
DependsOn: pkg/core/NeuroScript.g4
HowToUpdate: Read the file pkg/core/NeuroScript.g4 and deduce the correct EBNF from it.

The language is currently defined by pkg/core/NeuroScript.g4. At some point, this file will come to be the offical definition, but not yet.

**Notes on this EBNF:**

* **Line Continuation:** The grammar assumes line continuation (`\`) is handled *before* this syntax is applied, joining physical lines into logical lines.
* **Whitespace/Newlines:** Whitespace is generally implied between tokens. `newline` is explicitly mentioned where significant (e.g., after `THEN`/`DO`, terminating lines). `blank_line` allows empty lines.
* **Comments:** Comments (`#` or `--`) are treated like whitespace â€“ they can generally appear anywhere whitespace is allowed and are ignored by the structural parsing.
* **Docstring Content:** The `comment_block` syntax doesn't enforce the internal structure (`PURPOSE:`, etc.). This is treated as a semantic requirement on the `text_line` content.
* **Expressions/Conditions:** These are simplified. A real implementation would need operator precedence, more operators (arithmetic, boolean, comparison), and potentially function calls within expressions if desired.
* **Literals:** `numeric_literal` and `boolean_literal` definitions are placeholders. Escape sequences in strings are basic.
* **Keywords:** Identifiers cannot be the same as reserved keywords (case-insensitive check recommended).
* **TODOs:** Explicitly marked features from the spec that aren't fully defined in this grammar or implemented yet.

This EBNF provides a more formal definition of the NeuroScript syntax based on our progress.
