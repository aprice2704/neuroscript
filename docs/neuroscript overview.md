# NeuroScript: A Pseudocode Framework for AI Reasoning

Version: 0.1.0  

## Foundation

The NeuroScript project (NS) aims to allow Humans, AIs and computers to communicate in clear, reliable, repeatable ways by providing more structured means than just natural language.

The neuroscript script language (ns) is a structured, human-readable language that provides a *procedural scaffolding* for execution. It is designed to store, discover, and reuse **"skills"** (procedures) with clear docstrings and robust metadata, enabling everyone to build up a library of **reusable, well-documented knowledge**. It is intended to be primarily READ by humans, WRITTEN and EXECUTED by AIs and EXECUTED by computers.

NeuroScript interpreters, such as gonsi, are intended to execute NeuroScript scripts on conventional (von Neumann) computers, but are expected to make heavy use of AI abilities via API.

neurodata formats are intended as easy ways for humans, AIs and computers to store, share and edit smallish amounts of data to deal with everyday issues. neurodata provides ways to **template** data items as well as specifying how should be rendered and manipulated.

## Principles

1. Readability: all users must be able to read, and in principle change, NS formats of all kinds without having to resort to documentation for simple changes.
2. Executability: similarly, eveyone should be able to follow the intent of all scripts so that anyone could, in principle, execute NS files.
3. Clarity: The preeminent focus of all NS files should be clarity of understandin 

**Embedded Metadata**: Whereever practical, ns files should include within them their version, what files they depend on, and how to update them when those dependencies change.
