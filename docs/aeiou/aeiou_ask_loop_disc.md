# How the AEIOU ask loop might work

AJP:
Here is how I would like to extend the protocol to allow tool use looping by the AI:

I think we need to change that a little. Please compare this to what the standard says. 

1. if the agentmodel has a flag set to indicate it is allowed (e.g. ToolLoopPermitted) ...

2. execution proceeds as described, BUT, IF there is any output from ACTIONS (perhaps other than a magic string) it is sent as OUTPUT back to the AI.

3. If the agent model is not permitted the loop OR the ACTION output is empty (or some magic string) then the OUTPUT is returned as the final result.

4. The AI may, at their discretion, behave in the same way.

Please opine on whether this would work well (resource checks not added in yet, but assumed)

GPT5: Short answer: yes—your loop fits the spec with **no changes to AEIOU**. It’s an **outer control policy** in the gateway, not a language feature. You’re using the spec’s guarantees—**single side-effect surface (A/E)**, **OUTPUT is inert**, and **U→I→E→A** ordering—to stitch turns together safely. The only thing I’d tighten: use **explicit loop control markers** in the `emit` stream (not “empty”/ambiguous heuristics).&#x20;

Here’s a crisp read on each point and what I’d tweak.

### Does it square with the spec?

* **ToolLoopPermitted flag (host policy):** Perfect. AEIOU leaves the outer orchestration up to you; caps/budgets are enforced *inside* a turn, not across turns. Gate looping on the agentmodel, and also include `MaxTurns`, `MaxFuel`, `MaxWallClock` to prevent runaway.&#x20;
* **Send ACTIONS output back as next-turn OUTPUT:** Allowed. The spec treats OUTPUT as inert text; using last turn’s `emit` lines as the next turn’s **O** is exactly the “teaching loop” implied by the patterns (e.g., emitting a plan). You’re not executing the text; you’re just presenting it back to the model.&#x20;
* **Stop if loop not permitted or if special condition met:** Sensible. Instead of “empty output,” prefer an *explicit* sentinel to avoid accidental termination on whitespace or logging noise.
* **“The AI may behave the same way”:** Fine in spirit, but keep **one canonical loop controller** (the gateway). The model can *request* continuation or stop via explicit markers; the host decides based on policy & budgets. That keeps resource control centralized.

### Make the stop/continue unambiguous (no “magic emptiness”)

Reuse the spec’s diagnostic style so it’s teachable and machine-robust:

```txt
@@@ [[loop:continue]]            # model requests another tool pass
@@@ [[loop:done]]                # model says it’s finished
@@@ [[loop:abort:reason=...]]    # model hit a hard stop
```

Rationale: these are just *strings in OUTPUT*, so you’re not violating “OUTPUT is inert”; the gateway is allowed to parse emitted text for orchestration (the spec already shows emitting structured plans).&#x20;

### Minimal host algorithm (deterministic, budgeted)

```go
// Pseudocode-quality; wire to your actual model + interpreter interfaces.
type AskLoopOpts struct {
	ToolLoopPermitted bool
	MaxTurns          int           // e.g., 4
	MaxFuel           int           // optional aggregate token/fuel budget
	MaxWallClock      time.Duration // optional
}

type TurnIO struct {
	O string // what we show the model as OUTPUT on that turn
	U string // static userdata sidecar, usually constant across turns
}

func RunAskLoop(ctx context.Context, model AgentModel, interp Interpreter, in TurnIO, opts AskLoopOpts) (finalO string, turns int, err error) {
	const continueMark = "[[loop:continue]]"
	const doneMark     = "[[loop:done]]"

	allowed := opts.ToolLoopPermitted
	maxTurns := opts.MaxTurns
	if maxTurns <= 0 { maxTurns = 1 } // at least one pass

	turnO := in.O
	start := time.Now()
	var prevHash string

	for t := 1; t <= maxTurns; t++ {
		turns = t

		// 1) Ask model for AEIOU envelope given (O,U)
		env := model.Compose(turnO, in.U)      // host→LLM (AEIOU with O/U populated)
		resp := model.Infer(ctx, env)          // LLM→host (AEIOU with I/E/A/O)
		if err := resp.Validate(); err != nil { return resp.O, t, err }

		// 2) Execute one AEIOU turn: U→I→E→A (enforced by interpreter)
		run := interp.Execute(ctx, resp)       // collects all ACTIONS emits (strings)
		if run.Err != nil { return strings.Join(run.Emits, "\n"), t, run.Err }

		// 3) Consolidate emits as textual OUTPUT for the next turn
		nextO := strings.Join(run.Emits, "\n") // the only thing we feed back to O

		// 4) Loop control & progress checks
		if !allowed {
			return nextO, t, nil
		}
		if strings.Contains(nextO, doneMark) {
			return nextO, t, nil
		}
		if strings.Contains(nextO, continueMark) {
			// proceed
		} else if strings.TrimSpace(nextO) == "" {
			// no explicit request; stop by policy
			return nextO, t, nil
		}

		// Progress guard: if the emit stream repeats exactly, stop.
		h := sha256.Sum256([]byte(nextO))
		hash := hex.EncodeToString(h[:])
		if hash == prevHash {
			// no progress; avoid thrash
			return nextO + "\n[[loop:halt:reason=no-progress]]", t, nil
		}
		prevHash = hash

		// Budget guards (fuel/time), left schematic here
		if opts.MaxWallClock > 0 && time.Since(start) > opts.MaxWallClock {
			return nextO + "\n[[loop:halt:reason=timeout]]", t, nil
		}
		// if exceeded(opts.MaxFuel) { ... }

		// 5) Prepare for next turn
		turnO = nextO
	}

	return turnO + "\n[[loop:halt:reason=max-turns]]", turns, nil
}
```

### Subtleties worth locking down

* **Idempotence is your safety net.** You already require A/E calls to be idempotent or CAS-guarded; that makes loop replays safe.&#x20;
* **Scope of what gets fed back:** Only the **ACTIONS `emit` stream** becomes next-turn **O**. Do **not** echo interpreter logs, diagnostics about truncation, or random stderr unless you *want* the model to reason about them. The spec’s diagnostic stubs are for teaching; keep them, but consider prefixing runtime noise with a filterable tag.
* **Events in a loop:** Allow, but treat them as edge-trigger helpers. If your loop calls tools that fire events, ensure handlers are idempotent or noop when re-invoked in subsequent turns (the spec already says E must be idempotent).&#x20;
* **Termination policy precedence:** `ToolLoopPermitted=false` > time/fuel ceilings > `[[loop:done]]` > `[[loop:continue]]` > empty output. Deterministic ordering prevents “both sides tried to stop/continue” races.
* **Don’t rely on emptiness alone.** Keep it as a *fallback* only. Models can accidentally produce whitespace or logs; require `[[loop:continue]]` for positive continuation.

### Minimal additions to the (non-normative) patterns section

You can document this as a *host orchestration pattern*, not a change to AEIOU itself:

```txt
@@@ ### 5.4 Ask-Loop (host-controlled)
@@@ When ToolLoopPermitted is true, the host MAY feed the ACTIONS emit stream of turn N as
@@@ the OUTPUT of turn N+1. The model SHOULD signal intent explicitly using:
@@@   [[loop:continue]] | [[loop:done]] | [[loop:abort:reason=...]]
@@@ Hosts MUST enforce resource ceilings (turns/fuel/time) and SHOULD stop on no-progress.
```

### Verdict

Your 1–4 read as a clean policy layer on top of AEIOU. With explicit `[[loop:*]]` markers and hard caps, it will work well and remain deterministic, auditable, and hard to abuse—all while staying within the spec’s core invariants (single side-effect surface; inert OUTPUT; U→I→E→A).&#x20;

If you want, I can tighten the gateway helper into a concrete `pkg/gateway/askloop.go` with interfaces matching your interpreter, plus a couple of unit tests that simulate `[[loop:continue]]/[[loop:done]]` and no-progress halts.




gemini2.5: You've proposed an excellent and powerful refinement to the `ask` statement's execution flow. Introducing a controlled, iterative loop transforms it from a single-shot query into a true agentic engine.

Here is my opinion on its suitability, comparing it against the `aeiou_spec_v1.md` standard.

### **Suitability Analysis**

Your proposal is **highly suitable** and aligns perfectly with the philosophy of the AEIOU protocol. It builds upon the existing standard without violating its core principles, adding a new layer of capability for trusted agents.

---
### **Comparison with AEIOU v1 Specification**

* **Compliance**: The proposal is **fully compliant**. The core U → I → E → A execution order for a single turn is preserved, as required by the spec. The looping mechanism you've described is a meta-process that orchestrates multiple, compliant AEIOU exchanges.

* **Use of `OUTPUT` Section**: Your use of the `OUTPUT` section is correct. The specification designates `OUTPUT` as the channel for "Natural-language context / prompt / notes" from the host to the AI. Using the result of an `ACTIONS` block as the `OUTPUT` for the *next* turn is a perfect implementation of this, as it provides the AI with the context resulting from its previous actions.

* **Role of `ACTIONS` Section**: The proposal correctly identifies the `ACTIONS` block as the sole source of side effects and the driver of the loop. The value returned from this block serves as the signal for whether to continue the loop or terminate.

---
### **Key Strengths of the Proposal**

1.  **Controlled Agency**: The introduction of a `ToolLoopPermitted` flag is a critical security and control feature. It allows the system owner to explicitly grant trusted agent models the power to perform multi-step tasks, preventing uncontrolled loops from less-trusted models.

2.  **Clear Termination Contract**: The condition for terminating the loop—an empty or "magic string" from the `ACTIONS` block—is a simple and unambiguous signal. It provides a clear contract for the AI to follow: "if you have more work to do, return a summary of your actions; if you are done, return nothing."

3.  **Stateful Interaction**: This model elevates `ask` from a simple function call to a stateful, conversational turn. This is essential for complex tasks that require an AI to gather information, act on it, and then refine its plan based on the outcome.

4.  **Flexibility**: The protocol allows both the interpreter and the AI to decide when to terminate the loop, providing a flexible and robust system. The AI can signal completion, and the interpreter can enforce termination if the agent model is not permitted to loop.

In short, your proposed changes are a logical and powerful extension of the AEIOU protocol, turning the `ask` statement into a sophisticated engine for agentic workflows.







gpt5: Got you. Let’s make the **ask loop** dead-simple, deterministic, and hard to misuse. Think of it as a tiny state machine wrapped *around* AEIOU, not *inside* it.

```txt
@@@ # The Ask Loop — explained plainly
@@@
@@@ ## The big idea
@@@ One AEIOU turn = U → I → E → A. Your gateway runs that once.
@@@ The "ask loop" is just the gateway deciding to run another turn (or not),
@@@ based ONLY on what the ACTIONS block emitted.
@@@
@@@ ## Who is in charge?
@@@ - The gateway (host) is the sheriff. It decides whether to keep looping.
@@@ - The model can REQUEST another loop by saying so in the emit text.
@@@ - You must set hard limits (turns, time, fuel). The sheriff can halt any time.
@@@
@@@ ## What gets fed back?
@@@ Only the ACTIONS `emit` lines become the next turn's OUTPUT.
@@@ - Not interpreter logs.
@@@ - Not stderr/noise.
@@@ - Not stack traces (unless you want the model to reason about them).
@@@
@@@ ## How does the model ask to continue or stop?
@@@ Two equivalent options. Pick one and be consistent:
@@@ 1) Markers (easy to read): 
@@@    [[loop:continue]]  |  [[loop:done]]  |  [[loop:abort:reason=...]]
@@@    The gateway may also add [[loop:halt:reason=...]] when it stops things.
@@@
@@@ 2) One-line control JSON (machine-first, human-second):
@@@    {"loop":"continue","notes":"...", "plan_digest":"sha256:..."}
@@@    Then the rest of OUTPUT can be human-friendly prose.
@@@
@@@ ## Priority when there are mixed signals
@@@ If multiple signals appear, resolve deterministically:
@@@ abort  >  halt  >  done  >  continue
@@@
@@@ ## When to continue?
@@@ Conservative rule: Only continue if an explicit "continue" signal is present.
@@@ Empty or ambiguous text SHOULD NOT cause another loop.
@@@
@@@ ## Progress guard (no hamster wheels)
@@@ Compare a small "control digest" across turns. If it's unchanged, stop.
@@@ That digest should cover the control JSON (or marker set) + any PLAN JSON,
@@@ but NOT timestamps or random prose that would change every turn.
@@@
@@@ ## Idempotence (replay safety)
@@@ - Memory writes should be CAS (compare-and-swap) or transactional.
@@@ - For risky actions, use a two-step Plan→Apply:
@@@   Turn N: emit PLAN (no writes) → next turn applies if policy allows.
@@@
@@@ ## Limits (non-negotiable)
@@@ - MaxTurns (e.g., 4)
@@@ - MaxWallClock (e.g., 30s)
@@@ - Fuel/Token ceilings (per-turn and total)
@@@
@@@ ## State between turns
@@@ Prefer server-side scratch with TTL:
@@@   tool.scratch.Get(key) → (val, ver)
@@@   tool.scratch.PutCAS(key, ver, val, ttl)
@@@ Don't stuff secrets or raw cursors into OUTPUT unless redacted.
@@@
@@@ ## Events in loops
@@@ Events (E) are fine, but handlers MUST be idempotent: safe to re-run.
@@@ De-duplicate by (event_id, loop_id, turn_id) if useful.
@@@
@@@ ## Observability
@@@ Stamp a loop_id and turn_id onto:
@@@ - every tool call
@@@ - the ACTIONS emit lines
@@@ - the gateway audit log
@@@
@@@ ## Failure messages (teach the model)
@@@ Reuse the spec's style everywhere:
@@@ [[denied:tool.memory.CAS:capability_missing]]
@@@ [[truncated:OUTPUT:bytes=... allowed=...]]
@@@ [[invalid:ACTIONS:missing_command]]
@@@ [[loop:halt:reason=no-progress]]
```

## Concrete: what a loop looks like

### Turn 1 — model probes and proposes a plan

```neuroscript
command
  let caps = tool.system.Caps()
  if !caps["memory:write"] {
    emit `[[loop:abort:reason=capability-missing-memory:write]]`
    return
  }

  # Build a plan, *no writes yet*
  let plan = [{"op":"set","path":"/ingest/queue/x","value":"taken"}]
  emit `{"loop":"continue","plan_digest":"sha256:abc123"}`
  emit "PLAN " + json(plan)
  emit "Next: apply plan if policy allows."
endcommand
```

**Gateway decision:** sees `{"loop":"continue",...}` → permitted → runs Turn 2.
**What becomes next OUTPUT:** exactly the three `emit` lines (control JSON + PLAN + prose).

---

### Turn 2 — model applies if allowed

```neuroscript
command
  # Parse the PLAN from previous OUTPUT (or fetch from scratch)
  let ok = tool.policy.Allow(plan)    # returns bool
  if !ok {
    emit `{"loop":"done","notes":"policy blocked"}`
    return
  }

  let _, ver = tool.memory.Get("/ingest/queue/x")
  let ok2, _ = tool.memory.CAS("/ingest/queue/x", ver, "taken")
  if !ok2 {
    emit `{"loop":"continue","notes":"CAS failed; retry once"}`
    return
  }

  emit `{"loop":"done","notes":"applied 1 op"}`
  emit "Applied 1 op to /ingest/queue/x"
endcommand
```

**Gateway decision:** sees `{"loop":"done"...}` → stop; return these `emit`s as the final result.

---

## Exactly what the gateway should do (step-by-step)

```txt
@@@ 1) Build O and U for the first turn. U is the sidecar data; O is the prompt/context.
@@@ 2) Ask the model → get AEIOU envelope (I/E/A/O).
@@@ 3) Interpreter executes one turn: U→I→E→A. Collect ACTIONS emits as []string.
@@@ 4) Join emits with '\n' → call that nextO.
@@@ 5) If ToolLoopPermitted is false → return nextO and stop.
@@@ 6) Parse control:
@@@    - If first line is JSON and has {"loop":"..."} use that.
@@@    - Else scan markers in text: [[loop:continue]] / [[loop:done]] / [[loop:abort:...]]
@@@ 7) Apply precedence: abort > halt > done > continue.
@@@ 8) Enforce limits: time, turns, fuel. On breach append [[loop:halt:reason=...]] and stop.
@@@ 9) Progress guard: hash(normalized-control + any PLAN JSON). If unchanged from last turn, halt.
@@@ 10) If "continue" → set O = nextO and go back to step 2 for the next turn.
@@@ 11) Otherwise → return nextO.
```

---

## Why we don’t use “empty output means done”

* It’s ambiguous (whitespace? logging noise?).
* Requiring **explicit** `continue` keeps control with the gateway and prevents accidental loops.
* You can still treat empty as “done” as a *fallback* if you like, but don’t rely on it.

---

## What to add to your tools (minimal but mighty)

```txt
@@@ tool.system.Caps()             # probe capabilities
@@@ tool.capsule.List/Read()       # fetch short specs when confused
@@@ tool.memory.Get/CAS()          # idempotent writes
@@@ tool.policy.Allow(plan) -> (ok, why?)  # gate risky operations and report "why"
@@@ tool.scratch.Get/PutCAS(key,ver,val,ttl) # small server-side state between turns
```

---

## Test checklist (fast, meaningful)

```txt
@@@ - "continue" honored, within MaxTurns
@@@ - "done" stops immediately
@@@ - "abort" beats "continue"
@@@ - mixed markers: "done"+"continue" → stops (precedence rule)
@@@ - no-progress: same control digest two turns → halt with [[loop:halt:reason=no-progress]]
@@@ - OUTPUT truncation: over cap → include [[truncated:OUTPUT:...]] and still parse control
@@@ - timeout: stop with [[loop:halt:reason=timeout]]
@@@ - events idempotent: handler called twice but no double effect (prove with CAS)
@@@ - scratchpad replay: cursor only advances once on replayed turn
```

---

## Tiny patterns you can reuse

**Two-channel OUTPUT (machine first, then human):**

```txt
{"loop":"continue","notes":"plan ready","plan_digest":"sha256:abc123"}
Human notes start here. These can be long and friendly.
```

**Host-decided halts (always visible):**

```txt
[[loop:halt:reason=max-turns]]
[[loop:halt:reason=timeout]]
[[loop:halt:reason=no-progress]]
```

**Human-in-the-loop pause:**

```txt
[[loop:await:approval_id=Q7K2G]]
```

Gateway pauses, waits for approval, then resumes the same loop/turn.

---

### Bottom line

* Keep AEIOU untouched.
* Use **explicit** loop signals, small control JSON, and hard limits.
* Only feed back **ACTIONS emits**.
* Make writes replay-safe (CAS) and risky work two-phase (Plan→Apply).
* Stamp loop\_id/turn\_id and log everything.

If you want, I can turn this into a short `askloop.md` capsule and a couple of minimal Go tests that assert the precedence rules and progress guard with a fake interpreter.
