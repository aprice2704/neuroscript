func main() means
  :: purpose: Main entry point for the script. Walks the current directory and prints file paths.
  :: caveats: This version assumes tool.FS.Walk returns a list of maps on success and relies on on_error for tool call failures.
  on_error means
    emit "An error occurred during script execution."
    fail
  endon
  set allEntries = tool.FS.Walk(".")
  must typeof(allEntries) == TYPE_LIST
  emit "Files found:"

      emit "- " + entry["pathRelative"]
    endif
