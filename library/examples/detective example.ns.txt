DEFINE PROCEDURE InvestigateMurderScene(CrimeSceneData)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Orchestrate a murder investigation at a crime scene by coordinating sub-tasks 
             like securing the scene, gathering evidence, interviewing witnesses, 
             and generating a preliminary case report.
    INPUTS: 
        - CrimeSceneData: structured info about the scene (location, time, any known facts).
    OUTPUT: 
        CaseReport: a structured record of evidence, witness statements, possible motives, 
                      and recommended next steps.
    ALGORITHM:
        1. Secure the crime scene to preserve evidence.
        2. Gather and document physical evidence (photos, blood samples, weapons).
        3. Identify and interview witnesses.
        4. Analyze all collected data for leads or contradictions.
        5. Compile a preliminary report (CaseReport) summarizing findings and suspects.
    CAVEATS: 
        - Each step should be handled by specialized sub-procedures for detail (e.g. “SecureScene”, “InterviewWitnesses”).
        - Any suspicious or ambiguous findings might require extended LLM-based analysis or deeper forensic procedures.
    EXAMPLES:
        InvestigateMurderScene(LocationID=457) => returns a structured CaseReport summarizing 
        evidence, suspect list, and recommended follow-up actions.

DEFINE PROCEDURE SecureCrimeScene(CrimeSceneData)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Ensure no further contamination or tampering occurs.
    INPUTS: CrimeSceneData
    OUTPUT: None
    ALGORITHM:
        1. Establish perimeter.
        2. Restrict access only to authorized personnel.
        3. Document initial scene conditions.
ENDCOMMENT

DEFINE PROCEDURE GatherPhysicalEvidence(CrimeSceneData)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Collect and document tangible evidence (photos, footprints, potential weapon, etc.).
    INPUTS: CrimeSceneData
    OUTPUT: EvidencePackage: list of items, their locations, and relevant notes
    ALGORITHM:
        1. Photograph the entire scene thoroughly.
        2. Mark and collect all visible evidence, label them with IDs.
        3. Record location/time of collection in a log.
    CAVEATS:
        - Must be consistent with chain-of-custody procedures.
ENDCOMMENT

DEFINE PROCEDURE InterviewWitnesses(CrimeSceneData)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Capture witness statements and initial impressions.
    INPUTS: CrimeSceneData: which includes a list of identified witnesses
    OUTPUT: WitnessStatements: collection of statements
    ALGORITHM:
        1. For each witness in CrimeSceneData.witnesses:
            - Conduct a structured interview.
            - Record essential answers in text form.
        2. Store or append each statement to a master record.
ENDCOMMENT

DEFINE PROCEDURE AnalyzeEvidenceAndStatements(CrimeSceneData)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Combine all gathered evidence, witness statements, and generate a summarized analysis.
    INPUTS: CrimeSceneData: with appended witness statements + physical evidence data
    OUTPUT: analysisSummary: structured data capturing key findings, timeline, leads
    ALGORITHM:
        - Cross-reference times, discovered objects, footprints, etc. 
        - Flag contradictory or suspicious points.
ENDCOMMENT

DEFINE PROCEDURE CompileCaseReport(CrimeSceneData, analysisSummary, timelineInsights)
COMMENT:
    PURPOSE: Produce a preliminary "CaseReport" that investigators can use to guide next steps.
    INPUTS:
        - CrimeSceneData: 
        - analysisSummary: findings from AnalyzeEvidenceAndStatements
        - timelineInsights: optional deeper details from LLM calls
    OUTPUT: CaseReport: structured summary (suspects, timeline, recommended next steps)
    ALGORITHM:
        1. Synthesize a timeline from timelineInsights if present.
        2. List suspects, relevant evidence, open questions.
        3. Provide recommended next steps (further interviews, lab tests, etc.).
